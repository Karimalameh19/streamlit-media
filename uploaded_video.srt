44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It sounds really cool. I can't stand

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
wearing a suit every day.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
13

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,683

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Which do you prefer,

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
working late or finishing early?

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
14

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
00:01:21,683 --> 00:01:28,698

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I prefer finishing early. I really

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
enjoy the morning. I love getting up

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
15

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
00:01:28,698 --> 00:01:35,328

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
early and going for a run. There's

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
nothing like watching the sunrise

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
16

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:41,710

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
while drinking my morning coffee.

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Really. I am opposite.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
17

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,230

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I love sleeping in. I am most alert

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
in the evenings.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
18

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,990

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm a real night owl.

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
19

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:00,098

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You know what they say,

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
the early bird catches the worm. You

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
20

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:07,940

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
could be right. Maybe I will try to

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
go to bed a little earlier tonight.
